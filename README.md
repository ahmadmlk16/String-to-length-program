# String-to-length-program
/* 2. Write a program that uses Scanner to read two strings from the keyboard.
              Display each string, along with its length, on two separate lines.
              Then create a new string by joining the two strings, separated by a blank.
              Display the new string and its length on a third line.

              Algorithm:
              1. This program uses Scanner to read two strings from the keyboard then displays each string, along with its length.
              2. Ask user to enter two string.
              3. Save the two strings
              4. Print first string along with its length.
              5. Print second string along with its length.
